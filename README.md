## introDL

![](assets/neural_network.png)

The introductory project for the [Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101), designed to introduce the concepts of Neural Networks. This is technically not my first neural network, but it was still a really fun project, all of which is available in it's final format in [`introductory_neural_network.ipynb`](https://github.com/Vvkmnn/introDL/blob/master/introductory_neural_network.ipynb)

### Setup

This project is relatively minimal, but it requires Python 3 (Preferably as distributed by [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)), as well as a few additional packages that can be installed via:

        `conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook`
